# .Vim
This repository should help me to setup my environment for using vim in no time.
I use vim builtin package manager so the minimum supported vim version is 8.

# Plugins
1. airline
3. vim-fugitive: (git plugin)
4. tagbar
5. sensible

# Install
Run install script.

# Adding Plugin
Assuming clone the directory to the proper directory does the drill.
(Same as the Pathogen works, but for built in package manager)

1. Go to pack/plugin/(start|opt)/
2. `git submodule add <path to git repository>`
3. Add changes, include .gitmodules
